# i18n4js

Helper library to handle i18n (internationalization) in JS web apps.

Features this library offers:

- Determine language from a query string variable
- Dynamically loading translation files
- Translation or listing of strings

It was developed to quickly add basic i18n support to the [CindyJS apps](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/cindyjs-apps) 
and the [AppLauncher Mark II](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/applauncher2) and other future projects.
 
### Future development
 
Some features this library might implement in the future:

- Support for language files included statically through `<script>` elements.
- Support for translating strings with placeholders
- Support for plurals
